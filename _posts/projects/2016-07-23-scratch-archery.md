This is the last week of this term for code club.

As our final project, we’re going to build an archery game. The instructions can be found here:

[http://bit.ly/archery-cc](http://bit.ly/archery-cc)

## Resources
To get started quickly, you’ll need to use the scratch-pad through the link in the first step. If you do this, you will have access sprites without needing to set them up in your scratch environment.

Once you’ve opened the resources scratch-pad, click on the remix button in the top right corner to create your own version of the project.

## Random
To complete week's exercise you will need to create a target which moves around the screen. The target will move randomly, meaning that we won’t know where it is going to go next. You can use random when you want a result that you can’t predict. Random is very useful when creating games.
