This week, we’re going to build a chat-bot. The character you build will be able to have simple conversations with you. The instructions can be found here:

## Choices
You can use a choice when you need to tell your programme to do different things. A choice has two parts. The if and the else. If a condition is met our programme runs the first part, else it runs the second part.

Below, if the answer is “yes”, then we say one phrase, if it is “no” then we say something different.

## Variables
Variables are used to hold data or values. We can set variables, or we can update their values. Here we’re setting the variable “name” to our answer.
