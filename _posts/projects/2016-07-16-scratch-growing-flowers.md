## Resources
To get started quickly, you’ll need to use the scratch-pad through the link in the first step. If you do this, you will have access to the helicopter, flowers and water sprites without needing to set them up in your scratch environment.

Once you’ve opened the resources scratch-pad, click on the remix button in the top right corner to create your own version of the project.

* Sensing the environment to control changes to sprites
