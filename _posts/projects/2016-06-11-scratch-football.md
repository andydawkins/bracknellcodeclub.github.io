This week, we’re going to build a football game. The instructions for the game can be found here:

## Loops
A loop is a piece of code that repeats. Loops can repeat forever, or they can repeat until a condition is met.

In the example below, the ball will move until we press the space key. Pressing the space key will cause the loop to stop.

## Choices
You can use a choice when you need to tell your programme to do different things. A choice has two parts. The if and the else. If a condition is met our programme

runs the first part, else it runs the second part. Below, if  the ball is touching the goalie, we do something, else, we’ll do something different.

## Variables
Variables are used to hold data or values. We can set variables, or we can update their values. In this example, we set the timer variable to 30.
