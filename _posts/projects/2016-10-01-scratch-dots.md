## Challenges
This week’s puzzle contains a number of challenges. In each case, you’ll need to work out the right blocks of scratch code to pull together in order to make the game work.

## Clones
For the first part of the puzzle, you’ll be creating clones of dots. Clones are copies of an original item. In scratch it’s possible to run a block of code each time a clone is created. In the example below, the clone is moved to a position, pointed towards the controller and then moved towards it.
